WinDefCtl restore       # Restore Defender (remove IFEO + start services)
WinDefCtl rtp off       # Disable Real-Time Protection
WinDefCtl rtp on        # Enable Real-Time Protection

## ✅ WHAT'S NEW IN v2.0

**`kill` / `restore` — Full engine kill without restart**

- **IFEO offline hive bypass** — `RegSaveKeyEx` → `RegLoadKey(TempIFEO)` → write `Debugger=systray.exe` → `RegUnLoadKey` → `RegRestoreKey(REG_FORCE_RESTORE)` — bypasses Tamper Protection at kernel level
- **Ring-0 kill via `kvckiller.sys`** — digitally signed driver (service: `wsftprm`), loads without DSE bypass or HVCI restart; IOCTL `0x22201C` on `\\.\Warsaw_PM` terminates `MsMpEng.exe` + `SecurityHealthSystray.exe`; `SecurityHealthService` stopped via SCM
- **Driver embedded in icon** — LZX CAB appended to `.ico` resource, extracted at runtime via FDI in-memory decompression; no file dropped until `kill` is actually called
- **Smart service reuse** — if `wsftprm` already exists with a valid `kvckiller.sys` path (e.g. from KVC), it is reused without overwriting
- **Atomic cleanup** — service stop waits for `SERVICE_STOPPED` state before `DeleteService` (no zombie SCM entries); driver deleted only if WinDefCtl created the service

**Direct2D overlay (replaces console-maximization trick)**

- Full-screen `WS_EX_LAYERED | WS_EX_TOPMOST` window on a dedicated background thread
- DirectWrite: Consolas Bold 80pt, centered, pulsing green (sin-wave cycle ~6s), animated `PLEASE WAIT...` dots
- CRT scanline effect via Direct2D `DrawLine` overlay
- Shown during `rtp`/`tp` UI automation; not shown during `kill`/`restore` (silent operation)

**Build quality**

- `/MT` static CRT — no `vcruntime140.dll` / `MSVCP*.dll` dependency
- No PDB generated in Release build
- `build.ps1` full chain: driver pack → `GenIconSize.h` → MSBuild → timestamp → artifact cleanup
